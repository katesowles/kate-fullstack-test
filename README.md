##### once server is running, open an instance of POSTman and load the following URL `localhost:3000/api/images` with the dropdown set to GET. This should retrieve an empty array since nothing has been POSTed yet.
##### to post a caption/link set, follow the steps below:
1. change the dropdown to POST
2. click on "Body" beneath the URL bar to switch views
3. then select "Raw" to show that you're going to enter raw text instead of data into their key/value pair form
4. once you've done that, change the dropdown to JSON
5. enter your data in JSON format. Both the captions and the links are required so they must both be included.
6. Once you've done that, click the Send button
